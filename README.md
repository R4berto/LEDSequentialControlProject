Laboratory Activity #1: Working with Digital Signals

Objectives:
1. Review Arduino as a device for IoT systems implementation
2. Discuss digital signals and its implementation in a Arduino circuit.

Instructions:
1. We are instructed to create a running light circuit using Arduino
- We use pins 8 to 12 for the LEDs
- We made it Ran light from 12 to 8 with a delay of 1 second (turn all LED on one by one, then turn all LED off one by one)
- We use digitalWrite() to control the LEDs
